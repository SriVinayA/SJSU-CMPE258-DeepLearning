# Computer Vision Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the Computer Vision assignment. Below are the details of each part of the assignment:

## Part 1 - Supervised Contrastive Learning

In this part of the assignment, we explore supervised contrastive learning as a new loss function for supervised classification tasks. 

### Task
Write a Colab notebook demonstrating supervised contrastive learning loss-based supervised classification versus regular softmax-based classification. Provide necessary visualizations to showcase the effectiveness of the supervised contrastive learning approach.

## Part 2 - Transfer Learning on Various Modalities

This part focuses on transfer learning across different modalities such as images, videos, and audios. We will explore both feature extraction and fine-tuning use cases.

### Task
Write simple Colab notebooks to demonstrate transfer learning on images, videos, and audios. Use both feature extraction and fine-tuning approaches.

## Part 3 - Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

In this part, we explore zero-shot transfer learning using the CLIP model and other state-of-the-art models from TensorFlow Hub.

### Task
Showcase zero-shot transfer learning with the CLIP model and demonstrate transfer learning using state-of-the-art models from TensorFlow Hub.
