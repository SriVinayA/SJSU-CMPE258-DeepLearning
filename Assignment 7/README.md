- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the repository content and instructions.

## Part 1: Data Augmentation and Regularization

`part_1.ipynb` explores various data augmentation strategies for different data types (image, video, text, time-series, tabular data, speech, and document images) and regularization techniques including:
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Dropout and MonteCarlo Dropout
- Early stopping
- Various initialization methods
- Batch normalization
- Custom regularization and dropout techniques
- Utilization of callbacks and TensorBoard
- Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization
- Keras CV for data augmentation in computer vision tasks

References and further reading are linked directly in the notebook for deeper exploration.

## Running the Notebooks

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone URL_TO_THIS_REPOSITORY`
2. Open the notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter:
   - For Google Colab, upload the notebooks and then run them.
   - For Jupyter, navigate to the cloned repository directory and run `jupyter notebook`.
3. Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running the first few cells in each notebook that handle imports and installations.
