# AI Agents Assignment

This repository contains two primary components for the AI Agents assignment. The focus is on demonstrating the application and understanding of AI agents through practical implementation and exploration of various agent types, utilizing Python and the Langchain library. The assignments are structured as follows:

## Contents
- **agent.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that details the process of writing an agent from scratch in Python. This agent is designed to handle queries related to world population data and note-taking, showcasing the integration of different tools and libraries for creating a functional AI agent.
- **langchain.ipynb**: This notebook explores various agent types using the Langchain library. It demonstrates the flexibility and power of Langchain in processing natural language, including text summarization and translation.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the repository, setup instructions, and additional context for the projects contained within.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part A: Custom Python Agent
- **Objective**: Implement an AI agent from scratch using Python. The agent is built to perform specific tasks, such as querying world population data and saving notes, demonstrating the practical application of concepts discussed in class.
- **Inspiration**: The code is inspired by examples from class slides, showcasing how to leverage Python tools and libraries to create functional and interactive AI agents.

### Part B: Exploring Langchain Agents
- **Objective**: Utilize the Langchain library to demonstrate different types of agents, focusing on natural language processing tasks like text summarization and translation.
- **Approach**: The notebook provides examples and demonstrations based on the provided slide deck, highlighting the versatility and utility of Langchain for building sophisticated language models and agents.

## Setup and Usage

To run these notebooks:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in Google Colab.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with necessary libraries (pandas, openai, langchain, etc.). Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Colab and follow the instructions within to execute the code.

## Acknowledgments

This project is completed as part of the Deep Learning Course. The implementation is inspired by code examples from class slides and leverages the capabilities of the Langchain library for processing natural language.
