# AI Agents Assignment

This repository contains the solutions for the AI Agents assignment, which consists of two parts: creating an agent from scratch using Python tools and demonstrating various agent types using LangChain.

## Part A: Agent Implementation from Scratch

### Description
In this part of the assignment, an AI agent was implemented from scratch using Python tools. The goal was to create an agent without relying on pre-existing libraries or frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Implementation Details
The agent was implemented using Python, drawing inspiration from class slides and other relevant examples. Various AI techniques such as search algorithms, reinforcement learning, or other custom algorithms may have been employed in the implementation.

### Code Location
The code for the agent implementation can be found in the `agent_from_scratch.py` file.

## Part B: Demonstration of Various Agent Types with LangChain

### Description
In this part of the assignment, demonstrations of various agent types were provided using LangChain. LangChain is a platform for demonstrating AI concepts and techniques using Jupyter notebooks.

### Implementation Details
Several agent types were demonstrated using LangChain, showcasing their functionalities and capabilities. These demonstrations may include but are not limited to, search algorithms, reinforcement learning agents, and other AI techniques.
