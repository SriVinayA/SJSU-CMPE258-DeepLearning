Dr. Mehfuza Holia  \\nmsholia@bvmengineering.ac.in  \\nBirla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya, Gujarat, I ndia \\n \\nAbstract— In the digital age, the dynamics of customer \\nservice are evolving, driven by technological advancements and \\nthe integration of Large La ngua ge Models (LLMs). This resea rch \\npaper introduces a groundbreaking approach to automating \\ncustomer service using LangChain, a custom LLM tailored for \\norganizations. The paper explores the obsolescence of traditional \\ncustomer support techniques, particul arly Frequently Asked \\nQuestions (FAQs), and proposes a paradigm shift towards \\nresponsive, context -aware, and personalized customer \\ninteractions. The heart of this innovation lies in the fusion of \\nopen -source methodologies, web scraping, fine -tuning, and th e \\nseamless integration of LangCh ain into customer service \\nplatforms. This open -source  state -of-the-art framework, \\npresented as \"Sahaay,\" demonstrates the ability to scale across \\nindustries and organizations, offering real -time support and \\nquery resolution. Key  elements of this research encompass data \\ncollection via web scraping, the role of embeddings, the \\nutilization of Google\\'s Flan T5 XXL , Base and S mall language \\nmodel s for knowledge retrieval, and the integration of the \\nchatbot into customer service platfor ms. The results s ection \\nprovid es insights into the ir performance  and use cases, here \\nparticularly within an educational institution.  This research \\nheralds a new era in customer service, where technology is \\nharnessed to create effici ent, personalized, and r esponsive \\ninterac tions. Sahaay, power ed b y LangChain, redefines the \\ncustomer -company relationship, elevating customer retention, \\nvalue extraction, and brand image. As organizations embrace \\nLLMs , customer service bec omes a dynamic and customer -\\ncentric ecosy stem.  \\nKeywords — Customer  Service Automation, Large L anguage \\nModels, LangChain, Web Scraping, Context -Aware Interaction s \\nI.  INTRODUCTION  \\n“Customer is king” is the ancient  mantra reflecting the \\nsignificance of customers  in every business. In the digital age, \\nwhere the rhythms of mode rn life are guided by the pu lse of \\ntechnology, the realm of customer service stands as the \\nfrontline of engagement between businesses and their  clientele. \\nIt is the place where queries are an swered, problems are \\nresolved, and trust is forged.  \\nThis research  paper brings the future of customer service, \\nwhere automation, personalization, and responsiveness \\nconverge to redefine the customer -company r elationship. At \\nthe heart of this transformation  lies the integration of LLMs , \\nexemplifie d by LangChain  [1]. \\nIn the annal s of customer service history, FAQs  and \\ntraditional support mechanisms have long held sway. These \\nvenerable tools have dutifully served as repositories of \\ninformation, attempting to a ddress the queries and concerns of \\ncustom ers. However, as we stan d at the cusp of a new era in customer service automation, it becomes abundantly clear that \\nthe traditional methods once hailed as revolutionary, are \\ngradually becoming obsolete.  \\nThis paper i s an invitation to envision a future wher e \\ncustomer service is no t a cost center but a wellspring of \\ncustomer satisfaction and loyalty. We propose an open -source \\nframework that can be scaled to any industry or organization to \\nfulfill the consumer needs for  support and query resolution \\nwithin seco nds. \\nFor demonstration p urposes, we use the information \\npresented by Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya (BVM) \\nEngineering  College on their website \\nhttps://bvmengineering.ac.i n/ as the context for our chatbot, \\nfrom where it can retrieve al l the information in real -time and \\nanswer to any queries that are raised by the users. Here, users \\ncan be anyone ranging from prospective  students, current \\nstudents who intend to get informat ion from the Notice Board, \\nresearchers wh o wish to search for the ir potential research \\nguide, and so on. The applications are endless.  \\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY  \\nS. Kim (2023) et al addresses the challenge of deploying \\nresource -intensive large neural models, such a s Transformers, \\nfor information retrieval  (IR) while maintaining efficiency.  \\nExperimental results on MSMARCO benchmarks demonstrate \\nthe effectiveness o f this approach, achieving successful \\ndistillation of both dual -encoder and cross -encoder teacher \\nmodels into smaller, 1/10th size asymmetric stud ents while \\nretaining 95 -97% of the teacher\\'s performance  [2]. L. Bonifacio  \\net al (2022)  highlights the recent transformation in the \\nInformation Retrieval (IR) field, propelled by the emergence of \\nlarge pretrained tr ansformer models. The MS MARCO dataset \\nplayed a pivotal role in t his revolution, enabling zero -shot \\ntransfer learning across various tasks  [3]. \\nThis paper proposed a novel open -source ap proach to \\nbuilding LLM Chatbots using custom knowledge from the \\nconten t in the website.  It is unique i n several  ways: \\n1. We propose a n ope n-source framework which is robust \\nwith the type of dataset available on the webpage or \\nthe web of links.  \\n2. This implementation aims to compliment the use of \\nFAQs with a more interactive and us er-friendly  \\ninterface.  \\n3. We then do a c ompa rative study of various models, \\ntheir performance on  the provided data relative to the \\nexpected response from the LLM.

METHODOLOGY  \\nThis sect ion covers the data c ollection, details about the \\nselected model, fine -tuning, and integration with the Gradio \\nAPIs for web deployment.  \\nA. Data Collection  \\nTo gather the necessary data for our project, we employed \\nBeautifulSoup  web scraping techniques to retri eve publicly \\naccessib le information from an organization’s homepage. We \\nobserved this page is often linke d with all  the relevant \\ninformation required for the user/visitor. This approach \\nallowed us to collect a wide array of data, including customer \\nservice  FAQs, product manual s, support forums, chat logs, \\nassociated institutions,  and so on. This data further serves as \\nthe context for our  LLM . \\nB. Embeddings  \\nEmbeddings play a pivotal role in the development of any \\nLLM  powered . They are vector representation s of words or \\nphrases in a continuous mathematical space that capture \\nsemantic a nd contextual information, allowing the model to \\nunderstand the meaning and re lationships between words, \\nwhich is essential for pro viding meaningful responses to user \\nqueries.  \\nWe have used HuggingFace Instuct Embeddings – \\n“hkunlp/instructor -large” a text e mbedding model fine -tuned \\nfor specific t asks and domains, such as classificati on, retrieval, \\nclustering, and text evaluation  [4]. What sets Instructor apart is \\nits ability to gener ate tailored text embeddings without \\nrequiring additional fine -tuning. These  embeddings are then \\nstored using FAISS  (Facebook AI  Similarity Search)  library \\nthat allows developers to quickly search for embedd ings of \\nmultimedia documents that are similar to each other  [5]. \\nC. Language M odel \\nWe have chosen Google’s Flan T5 XXL as the mo st \\napprop riate language model after comp aring with other F lan T5 \\ndistributions to retrieve knowledge from the vectorspace  and \\nchat_history  (or memory)  [6]. The model  retains the context of \\nprevious messages  and uses that as a reference to predict \\nanswers f or the upcoming questions. This helps us ers to have \\nan interactive conversation with the chatbot, instead of a \\nmonotonous and robotic one.  \\nD. Integration with Customer Service Platforms  \\nA simple chat window ca n be activated at the corner of any \\nwebsite which would enable users to interact with the chatbot \\nand ask any relevant questions or doubts regarding the \\norganization.  However, fo r the d emons tration purpose of this \\npaper, we are using Gradio API framework  [7]. \\nIV. RESULTS  \\nIn this section, we mention the metric s of comparison, \\nprovide comparative ana lysis, and use cases in associ ation with \\nan educational institution.  A. Evaluating the Performance of LLMs  \\nIt is relatively difficul t to evaluate LangChain agents, \\nespec ially when trained on large chunks of context data sets for \\ninformation retrieval. Hence, t he current solution for the lack of \\nmetrics is to rely on human knowledge to get a sense of how \\nthe chain/agent is performing.  \\nIt is e vident from TABLE -I, II and II I that the XXL model \\noutperforms other competitive LLMs  such as BASE and \\nSMALL.  \\n \\nFig. 1.

The ability to obtain accurate re-\\nsponses by utilizing appropriate prompts through prompt engi-\\nneering demonstrates that chatbots can be utilized as educational\\nassistants. Therefore, advanced chatbot models such as ChatGPT\\nare commonly employed for this purpose. However, it is important\\nto note that ChatGPT does not consistently provide completely\\naccurate answers to all math questions. According to Shakarian et\\nal.[16], ChatGPT’s performance falls notably below the 60% accu-\\nracy achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms designed specifically\\nfor solving math word problems. The disparity arises due to the in-\\nherent differences between AI systems and human problem-solving\\nabilities.

Lastly, Section 5 concludes the\\npaper by presenting the key findings, summarizing the conclusions,\\ndiscussing the future research.\\n2 RELATED WORK\\nIn the field of mathematics, there has been a significant focus on\\nworking with current Large Language Models (LLMs) during the\\nprocess of solving word and numerical computational problems.\\nParticularly in the case of word problems, it is crucial to convert\\nexpressions that humans can understand into a logic that can be\\ncomprehended by machines. Zhang et al. [ 27] indicate that exist-\\ning systems in the literature have shown promising results when\\ntested on self-crafted and small-scale datasets. However, their per-\\nformance declines significantly when applied to large and diverse\\ndatasets, indicating the need for significant improvement in current\\nmathematics word problem (MWP) solvers. Zhang et al. [ 27] present\\na comprehensive survey that aims to provide a clear and compre-\\nhensive overview of automatic mathematics problem solvers. The\\nsurvey primarily focuses on algebraic word problems, highlight-\\ning the extracted features and proposed techniques to bridge the\\nsemantic gap. The performance of these solvers is compared us-\\ning publicly accessible datasets. Additionally, the survey explores\\nautomatic solvers for other types of mathematics problems, includ-\\ning geometric problems that involve diagram comprehension. The\\ntechnological trend in solving MWPs have been passed through\\nrule-based matching from 1960 to 2010, semantic parsing and statis-\\ntical learning from 2011 to 2017 and deep-reinforcement learning\\nfrom 2017 to nowadays. The rule-based solvers [ 2,6,14,17,26]\\nheavily depend on human interventions and are restricted to ad-\\ndressing a predetermined set of scenarios. Hence, the rewritten\\nquestions or addition of a simple subproblem to the problem may\\ncause the inability to solve the problem properly. During the second\\nstage of development, MWP solvers started incorporating semantic\\nparsing techniques. The aim was to convert sentences from problem\\nstatements into structured logic representations, enabling easier\\nquantitative reasoning. These methods employ diverse strategies\\nsuch as feature engineering and statistical learning to enhance per-\\nformance. These methods have focused on publicly available or\\nmanually collected datasets. The language understanding of the\\nquestions has been improved with respect to rule-based solvers\\nbut still the understanding might not directly enable to solve the\\nproblems in an iterative manner of subproblems. Around 2017, the\\nimpact of semantic parsing by new approaches for inferencing [ 9]\\nand the increase in deep learning [ 22] have been the workforce of\\nMWP solvers.\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) [ 22], encoder-decoder net-\\nwork [ 4], deep Q network [ 21], reinforcement learning [ 8] based\\napproaches are the preliminary approaches of deep learning untilthe rise of Transformer networks [ 18]. MWP-BERT and MWP-\\nRoBERTa [ 11], SciBERT and MathBERT [ 13] enable BERT based\\napproaches for mathematics word problems.\\nAnother MWP approach is the tree-based approaches [ 12,20,25]\\nand combination of tree-based approaches with Transformers [ 15].\\nTree-based approaches are commonly used to represent arithmetic\\nexpressions as binary tree structures. These approaches aim to con-\\nstruct an equivalent tree structure in a bottom-up manner, gradually\\ntransforming the derivation of the arithmetic expression. Notably,\\ntree-based approaches do not require additional annotations like\\nequation templates, tags, or logic forms. The algorithmic frame-\\nwork of these approaches involves two stages: the extraction of\\nquantities from the text to form the bottom level of the tree and\\nthe enumeration of syntactically valid candidate trees with differ-\\nent structures and internal nodes. In the second stage, a scoring\\nfunction is used to select the best matching candidate tree, which\\ndetermines the final solution.\\nThe state-of-the-art Transformer model, GPT, has been consid-\\nered for mathematics problems recently. Liang et al.[ 10] introduce\\na novel approach to distill mathematics word problem-solving ca-\\npabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more\\nefficient student models for leveraging LLMs. The method involves\\ngenerating an exercise book to evaluate student models and pro-\\nviding customized training exercises based on the specific learning\\nneeds of each student model. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nthis approach achieves higher accuracy than LLMs (such as GPT-3\\nand PaLM [ 5]) across three different benchmarks while utilizing\\nsignificantly fewer parameters.\\nWhen LangChain is a newly proposed technology, there is not\\na paper that compares ChatGPT and LangChain for mathematics\\nproblems in detail to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we\\npropose a categorization of mathematics question types and the\\ncorresponding errors, and use prompts to analyze the comparison\\nof ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and LangChain.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\nPrompt analysis is the main methodology of this study which refers\\nto the process of examining and understanding a given prompt\\nor question in various contexts, often in the context of natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks or AI models. Since the context is\\nmathematics in this study, we present a prompt analysis of ChatGPT\\nand LangChain by using different mathematical questions.\\nIn this section, we begin by introducing and categorizing differ-\\nent question types, as well as addressing the errors that occurred\\nin these questions. Subsequently, we present the questions used in\\nthe prompt analysis along with their results.\\n3.1 Categorization of Question Types and Error\\nTypes\\nWe posed two types of questions to ChatGPT and LangChain: word\\nproblems and numerical computational problems.

Language understanding-\\nbased errors in this paper refer to errors caused by a lack of under-\\nstanding of the problem. These errors are resolved by rewriting or\\nrephrasing the problem.\\nConceptual errors are used to describe the errors related with\\napplying the wrong theorem or formula in problem solving [ 7,23].\\nWe also categorize conceptual errors into three sub-categories:\\nproblem-based, subproblem-based and combination of mathemati-\\ncal concepts-based errors. Problem-based conceptual errors indicate\\na mistake made in applying the theorem or formula to the solution\\nas a whole. It can also be caused by a lack of knowledge of ChatGPT\\nor LLMMathChain. Subproblem-based conceptual errors refer to\\nerrors made specifically in the solution of sub-parts of the problem.\\nCombination of mathematical concepts-based errors occur due to\\na lack of correct utilization of a combination of different mathe-\\nmatical topics. Calculation errors involve mistakes in performing\\narithmetic operations. Our categorization of error types is shown\\nin Figure 1.\\n3.2 Prompt Analysis\\nIn this subsection, we introduce the questions used in our prompt\\nanalysis, along with their corresponding outcomes. Figure 2 pro-\\nvides an overview of the questions employed in the prompt analysis.\\nQuestion 1, which is a word problem, was answered correctly by\\nChatGPT as 6, while it was answered incorrectly by LLMMathChain.\\nLLMMathChain made the following evaluation: 5 - 2 + 4, which was\\nthought to us the indication a language understanding problem. We\\nrewrote the question as Question 1’ to support our idea. In that case,\\nLLMMathChain understood the question and responded correctly\\nas ChatGPT did.\\nQuestion 2 is also a word problem with the correct answer of\\n14. ChatGPT provided answers of 8, -8, 14, and 8, respectively.\\nAlthough ChatGPT correctly constructed the equation, it made a\\ncalculation error, resulting in incorrect answers in some attempts.\\nOn the other hand, LLMMathChain had a syntax error, which can\\nbe attributed to a language understanding-based error. We think\\nthat there might be an issue somewhere when using the models\\nemployed in LLMMathChain.The type of Question 3 is a word problem, and the correct an-\\nswer is 66. Initially, ChatGPT provided an incorrect answer because\\nit couldn’t formulate the equation of the solution accurately, re-\\nsulting in a problem-based error. When we asked the question\\nagain, ChatGPT provided another incorrect answer. In the third\\nattempt, ChatGPT was able to construct an equation that was close\\nto the correct one, with a result of 65. However, the answer still\\nremained incorrect. Similarly, LLMMathChain also provided incor-\\nrect answers due to a conceptual error related to the problem itself.\\nThe difference between ChatGPT and LLMMathChain was that\\nLLMMathChain consistently gave the same incorrect answer.\\nQuestion 4 is a word problem with the correct answer of 7. Chat-\\nGPT correctly answered this question. However, LLMMathChain\\nperformed the following evaluation: (4∗(20−3))/2+(20/4)∗∗( 1/2)\\nwhich resulted in an incorrect answer due to a subproblem-based\\nerror, which is a subcategory of conceptual error. Question 5 is yet\\nanother word problem with subproblems, and the correct answer\\nis 82. Although ChatGPT gave the correct answer, LLMMathChain\\ndid the following equation (52/2+52/3+2)+(40+(52/2+52/3+2)) and\\nresponded to the question wrongly. This issue is similar to Question\\n4, where LLMMathChain’s incorrect answer was also attributed to\\nan error in managing the subproblems.\\nQuestion 6 is a numerical computational problem which covers\\ntwo different topics of mathematics, and a method needs to be\\napplied while solving this question. The two different topics should\\nbe considered together. First, it is necessary to determine whether\\nthe content inside the absolute value is positive or negative. After\\nthis determination, the part inside the absolute value should come\\nout as a function, not numerically. However, ChatGPT calculates the\\ncontent inside the absolute value numerically first, which leads to an\\nerror. We define this type of error as errors based on the combination\\nof mathematical concepts. The same situation exists here as well\\nin ChatGPT. In short, Question 6 was answered incorrectly by\\nboth ChatGPT and LLMMathChain because they do not know how\\nto combine different topics in a problem solution. However, this\\nknowledge can be taught.\\nQuestion 7 is another numerical computational problem with\\nthe correct answer of -11. It involves different mathematical top-\\nics, namely absolute value, and derivative.

However, LLMMathChain encoun-\\ntered the same issue as in Question 6 and answered the question\\nincorrectly due to errors based on the combination of mathematical\\nconcepts.\\nTable 1 provides a summary of the questions that we asked, and\\nthe results obtained from ChatGPT and LLMMathChain. ChatGPT\\nwas more successful than LLMMathChain in these questions. Table\\n2 displays the match between question types and error types. As\\ncan be seen from the table, ChatGPT did not exhibit any language-\\nunderstanding-based or subproblem-based errors in our questions.\\nHowever, LLMMathChain experienced errors of all types except\\nfor calculation errors.\\n4 DISCUSSION\\nIn mathematics, the answers are typically deterministic, meaning\\nthere’s a specific correct answer. Hence, the mathematics softwares\\nmust provide consistent and accurate responses to prompts. How-\\never, since LMs are statistical in nature, we can change the methods\\nwe use to reach a solution. These changes can cause the answers to\\nvary each time, which goes against the nature of mathematics. Simi-\\nlarly, ChatGPT, by design, does not always give the same answer to\\nthe same question. It’s based on a Transformer model which is de-\\nsigned to generate diverse and creative outputs. This is particularly\\nuseful for tasks such as writing a story or generating a conversation,\\nwhere generative AI is the primary consideration. When it comes\\nto mathematics questions, the model doesn’t solve them in the\\nsame manner as a calculator. Instead, it generates responses based\\non patterns it learned during training. So, while it often provides\\ncorrect answers to mathematical questions, it might not alwaysbe consistent because it does not “understand” mathematics in the\\nway humans do. Its responses are based on patterns rather than\\nperforming calculations.\\nFigure 3 represents the combination of Natural Language Under-\\nstanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) in an LLM.\\nDuring the NLU stage, expressions written as word problems or\\nnumerical computational problems are transformed into a form that\\ncan be solved using mathematical methods. NLU is responsible for\\nconverting the problem into symbolic notation. Afterwards, NLG,\\nwith the help of extensive training data, should be able to apply\\nthe solutions it has learned to the problems expressed in the NLU\\nstage. To overcome the problem of non-deterministic features of\\nLLMs like ChatGPT, it requires training LLMs on diverse mathemat-\\nical datasets spanning a large number of questions from different\\nmathematics topics.\\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning\\nconcerned with training agents to make a series of decisions within\\nan environment. Its goal is to maximize the overall reward they\\nreceive. It draws inspiration from the way humans and animals\\nlearn by engaging in trial-and-error interactions with their sur-\\nroundings. ChatGPT benefits from reinforcement learning in its re-\\nward model called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\\n(RLHF) [ 24]. ChatGPT’s initial training is done using supervised\\nfine-tuning, where human AI trainers provide conversations and\\nmodel responses via RLHF. The advantage of this approach is to\\nteach the LLM with the situations where it has not encountered\\nuntil that time.

When compared to Figure 3, LangChain aims\\nto achieve more successful results by using mathematical software\\nor a model specifically trained for mathematics. Hence, the disad-\\nvantage of LLMs can be mitigated by leveraging the deterministic\\nnature of mathematics. LangChain allows you to use different LLMsserved by OpenAI or Hugging Face endpoints with various datasets\\nor softwares in combination to improve the performance of the sys-\\ntem.

While ML is an inductive reasoning-based approach, it is\\nthe difficulty of LLMs to handle the problems in a deductive man-\\nner. As logical systems such as propositional logic or first-order\\nlogic have a way of logical consequences for solution, these conse-\\nquences must also be learnt by LLMs with a vast amount of similar\\ndeduction-based problems. LangChain is expected to be capable of\\nsolving these problems by time in combination with GPT.\\n5 CONCLUSION\\nIn this study, an analysis and comparison of solving different mathe-\\nmatics problems, particularly word problems and numerical compu-\\ntational problems, have been presented using state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand LangChain. The process of learning mathematics with LLMs\\ndiffers significantly from the nature of mathematics itself. More-\\nover, the generative and statistical nature of LLMs is not inherently\\nwell-suited for deterministic fields like mathematics. However, it\\nis projected that with novel approaches such as LangChain, the\\naccuracy of mathematical question answering can be improved\\nover time. Therefore, it is evident that by nourishing the success\\nof LLMs in language comprehension aligned with the nature of\\nmathematics, a successful mathematics assistant can be developed.\\nIn future studies, all mathematics models and softwares that can\\nbe adapted to LangChain will be utilized with current LLMs, and\\nthe effectiveness of the Chain of Thought (CoT) method for unan-\\nswered questions will be determined. Additionally, considering the\\nutilization of tree-based methods, particularly decision trees for ex-\\nplainability in machine learning, efforts will be made to investigate\\nthe explainability of the mathematics question answering method\\nwithin the mathematics chain.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]Rachith Aiyappa, Jisun An, Haewoon Kwak, and Yong-Yeol Ahn. 2023.

You tell them things that youâ€™ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you canâ€™t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid itâ€™s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didnâ€™t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long dayâ€™s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, thereâ€™s no need for continuous conversation, but you find youâ€™re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that thereâ€™s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure thatâ€™s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”',\n",

Go ahead, shit on me, I donâ€™t mind, Iâ€™m the Cool Girl.Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe theyâ€™re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men â€“ friends, coworkers, strangers â€“ giddy over these awful pretender women, and Iâ€™d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men whoâ€™d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. Iâ€™d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesnâ€™t really love chili dogs that much â€“ no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: Theyâ€™re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, theyâ€™re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if youâ€™re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesnâ€™t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version â€“ maybe heâ€™s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe heâ€™s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesnâ€™t ever complain. (How do you know youâ€™re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: â€œI like strong women.â€� If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else.
