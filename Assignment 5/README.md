## Assignment Summary

This repository contains implementations of basic neural networks using various deep learning frameworks including NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in building neural networks from scratch and using built-in functionalities of these frameworks.

### Assignment Requirements

1. **Video Demonstration**: A video demonstrating the code walkthrough, explaining each section clearly, and showcasing the final output.

2. **GitHub Readme**: The readme should include the video and clean explanations of each Colab file along with their links and details.

3. **Implementation Tasks**:
   - Create a 3-layer neural network instead of the 2-layer network provided in the reference Colab.
   - Utilize TensorFlow `einsum` instead of matrix multiplication for operations.
   - Implement a 3-layer neural network for non-linear regression using NumPy, PyTorch from scratch, PyTorch with classes, PyTorch Lightning, and various TensorFlow variants (low level, API, functional, model, built-in).
   - Utilize synthetic data generated from a 3-variable-based non-linear equation provided in the class example.
   - Plot the synthetic data using a 4D plot.

### Implementation Details

1. **NumPy Implementation**: Implement a 3-layer deep neural network for non-linear regression manually, demonstrating backpropagation and gradient propagation using NumPy.

2. **PyTorch Implementation from Scratch**: Implement a 3-layer deep neural network for non-linear regression in PyTorch without using built-in layer functionalities.

3. **PyTorch Implementation with Classes**: Implement a 3-layer deep neural network for non-linear regression using PyTorch built-in functionalities like modules and backpropagation.

4. **PyTorch Lightning Implementation**: Implement the same network using PyTorch Lightning.

5. **TensorFlow Implementations**: Implement the network using various TensorFlow variants including low level, API, functional API, and built-in layers.

6. **JAX Implementation**: Repeat the above implementations using JAX.
